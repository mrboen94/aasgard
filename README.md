[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0880a2e1-8314-41ff-8886-a4115ee43825/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/aasgard/deploys)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

NOTE: This project is still very much a work in progress!

## Welcome to my web hosted CV

This website was built using react and styled components.

### Future plans

- ~~Add gatsby for faster loading and snappiness~~
- Prevent sidebar from mounting and unmounting when switching between pages (This can be done with a layout component, take a look at gatsby documentation)
- CSS all the things
- Add projects to projects page
- Add misc info to misc page
- Add themes
- Make mobile friendly
- Add download to pdf button

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `gatsby develop`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `gatsby build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
